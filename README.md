# FakeBusters: a Voting-Based Game for Fake News Detection
Fakebuster is an academic project, developed for the purpose of allowing the detection of Fake News, using a decentralized approach. The goal of this project is to provide a democratic way to manage the choice of which news should be marked as fake, in order to prevent possible bias from centralized entities.

Developed using Solidity smart contracts, it runs a truth discovery algorithm for the identification of Fake News through a voting-based game.
